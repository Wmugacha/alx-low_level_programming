Project 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops. Function prototypes for each file are in the alx.h header file. Each file in the project is as follows;

#0 is _putchar is writing a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line. This program shoud return 0.

#1 is writing a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. And _putchar can only be used twice in the code

#2 is write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. Also, _putchar can only be used twice in the code.

#3 is write a function that checks for lowercase character. It returns 1 if the letter is lowercase and return 0 otherwise.

#4 is write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

#5 is a program that prints the sign of a number

#6 is a program that computes the absolute value of an integer.

#7 is a program that prints the last digit of a number.

#8 is a program that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

#9 is a program that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

#10 is a program that adds two integers and returns the result.

#11 is a program that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
